Whether you’re alone, working closely with a team, or part of a distributed ecosystem working on open source products, you’re codebase evolves by making changes to it. For many reasons, it can be irresponsible to make changes to a codebase directly. Instead, developers create a copy of the codebase, make their required changes, and test their changes locally.



> Pull requests are the mechanism by which one developer asks that the changes they’ve made locally be merged (or “pulled”) into the existing codebase.
